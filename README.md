# Projet-C-Automate

For our C project, which is a significant part of our lives, we conducted documentation work before starting to write code. The goal was to thoroughly understand the topic of Finite State Machines and the C skills required.

This project also marked our first experience with a group programming project. It took some time to establish our shared working environment and task distribution. As per the project instructions, we created a repository on GitHub â€“ our first experience with this tool. There were a few hiccups as we familiarized ourselves with it.

For this project, it was necessary to divide the code into three distinct files: main.c, fsm.c (containing the definitions of functions), and fsm.h (its header file containing the prototypes of the fsm functions).

We tried to introduce automated tests for each commit on the main branch of our repository using a feature integrated into GitHub: .github/workflows/c-cpp.yml.

In light of our difficulties in C and to enhance group collaboration, we have decided to comment on each line of our code in French so that every member of the group can review and work on the project. Additionally, we experienced extended periods without working on the project, making it challenging to comprehend code written a few weeks earlier. We translated everything into English at the end of the project.
